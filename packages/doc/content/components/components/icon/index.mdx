# Icon

This icon works as a wrapper for our icons abstracting color, size and stroke usage, which are all received as strings
representing a spacing token name.

* Refer to [Icons](icons) to check already existing icons which can be used in conjunction with this component.
* Refer to [spacing](../guidelines/tokens/spacing) tokens to check possible string values for both width and height dimensions.
* Refer to [colors](../guidelines/tokens/colors) tokens to check possible string values for both fill and stroke properties.
