# Icon

The Icon works as a wrapper for our icons abstracting color, size and stroke
usage, which are all received as strings representing a spacing token name.

## Reference

- Refer to [Icons](icons) to check already existing icons which can be used in
  conjunction with this component.
- Refer to [spacing](../guidelines/tokens/spacing) tokens to check possible
  string values for both width and height dimensions.
- Refer to [colors](../guidelines/tokens/colors) tokens to check possible string
  values for both fill and stroke properties.
