## Breakpoints

A breakpoint maps the screen size with its layout requirements.

### Usage

This is a simple usage:

```javascript type=highlight
import styled from 'styled-components';
import { theme } from '@gympass/yoga';

const MyCoolComponent = styled.div`
  width: ${theme.breakpoints.xxs}px;
`;
```

<ThemeBreakpoints />
